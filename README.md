# Reversi-Othelo

> An implementation of the Reversi game (Othello) with Python and the Mini Max Algorithm

## What is Reversi

Reversi is a turn-based two-player strategy board game. The players take turns placing pieces, one player white and the other player black, on an 8x8 board in such a way that captures some of the opponent's pieces, with the goal of finishing the game with more pieces of their color on the board.

### Description

The game begins with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two whites and two blacks facing up, with the similar pieces in a diagonal position of each other.
Each player must place a piece of his color on the board, in such a position that there exists at least one straight(horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another piece of his color, with one or more contiguous opponent's pieces between them, capturing this way the opponents pieces.
